            <h2>Slytherin House</h2>
            <img class="profilepic" src="resource/png/hogwarts.png" width="250px">
            <p class="p-long">
                Slytherin was one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar
                Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few
                particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness,
                leadership, and ambition. Many Slytherin students tended to clique together, often acquiring leaders,
                which further exemplified Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these included Draco Malfoy's
                gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and the Death Eaters.
                The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it could be
                a factor when being sorted. Students of any blood status could be placed in the house. However, a
                Muggle-born student from that house was considered to be quite rare.
                The emblematic animal of the house was a snake and the house's colours were green and silver. There were
                two notable heads of the house; Horace Slughorn took the role twice (first leaving in 1981 and then
                taking the role again from 1997 until leaving before 2016), and Severus Snape. The patron ghost of the
                house was the Bloody Baron.
                Slytherin corresponded roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with
                the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible
                animals. Similarly, in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to
                speculate that the element was chosen to symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pure-blood only
                community. The colours also corresponded with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and
                silver being often associated with grey rainwater.

                Professor Salazar Slytherin is a purebred Mage who lived in the Middle Ages. He is a Parseltongue (Mage
                who can talk, control snakes) and is very skilled in Philosophers. He is one of the four founders of
                Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Godric's old best friend. Gryffindor. Slytherin did not
                trust Muggle Students, and suggested that they should not be admitted to the school. However, other
                founders disagree. Slytherin created a 'Secret Chamber' that hid the Dead Snake in it and left the
                school.He died in the Middle Ages.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p class="p-long">
                Slytherin's opposition over the idea to allow witches and wizards from half-blood and Muggle-born
                heritage to enrol at Hogwarts during its foundation created great controversy at the school and it was
                the root of a feud between former friends Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor. Slytherin later decided to
                leave the school when an argument started between him and Gryffindor, and they either duelled or started
                a civil war between the two houses. Such an argument would be forever known as the origin of the feud
                between their two houses and also made them the houses that are most competitive.
                When Slytherin departed Hogwarts, he would leave behind the Chamber of Secrets with the purpose of an
                heir opening the chamber one day and unleashing a means of purging the school of those who, in his view,
                were unworthy to study magic: Muggle-borns. The chamber was opened twice and the Serpent of Slytherin
                was killed the second time by Harry Potter in 1992. Slytherin's views at the time could be attributed to
                the persecution of witches and wizards at the hand of Muggles during that century.

        <h2>Traits</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="p-long">
                Slytherins tended to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. They also
                had highly developed senses of self-preservation. This means that Slytherins tended to hesitate
                before acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done.
                According to Albus Dumbledore, the qualities which Salazar valued in the students he had chosen included
                cleverness, resourcefulness, determination, and "a certain disregard for the rules". Dumbledore noted
                that all of these were qualities possessed by Harry Potter, who was a Gryffindor but was almost placed
                in Slytherin.
                Slytherins tended to take charge and possessed strong leadership skills. They were often self-assured
                and confident of their own competence and can be very loyal.
                Another characteristic some Slytherins share was a tendency towards deep, unrequited love. Severus Snape
                and the Bloody Baron held abiding but unreturned feelings for Lily Evans and Helena Ravenclaw,
                respectively. Although some Slytherins, such as Tom Riddle, were incapable of feeling love at
                all, those that did were known to cherish their passion abidingly and unconditionally, although often
                tragically due to an inability to act appropriately on their feelings. Interestingly, Bellatrix
                Lestrange held feelings for Tom Riddle himself, which was a factor in her fanatical devotion to the
                Death Eaters; although Lord Voldemort was incapable of loving her in return, the existence of Delphini
                suggests that there was at least some kind of intimacy between them.
                Although Merope Riddle likely never attended Hogwarts and therefore wouldn't have been sorted into
                Slytherin at all, she was a descendant of Slytherin himself and fit the pattern of those sorted into his
                house, as she held deep and unreturned feelings for Tom Riddle Snr, who often travelled by her house on
                his carriage.
